# Manyo - React/Next components

> A collection of React components to standarice mypersonal brand

Manyo comes from the spanish word `ma√±o` wich is a coloquial demonym for the people of the province of Zaragoza, Spain (where I'm originally from). It can come from the latin word `magnus` wich means `great` or `big`.

This component library doesn't aim to be a general/great/big purpose library, but a collection of components that I use in my personal projects.

Feel free to use it, but I won't be active on this project, so don't expect any support.

## Installation

Update your `~/.npmrc` file to include the following line.

```bash
# ~/.npmrc
registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/
@jorgechato:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/
```

Then install the package.

```bash
npm install @jorgechato/manyo
```

## List of components you can use

```js
import {
    Footer, Header, Logo, // for basic layout

    // COMMING SOON
    Article, ArticleList, Tags, // for cms content
    Readme, // for code content
    Indicator, Project, ProjectList, // for status page
    Repository, RepositoryList, // for github repos
} from '@jorgechato/manyo'
```

### Basic layout components

- Footer
- Header
- Logo

This is an example of the basic layout you can create with these components.

```js
info = {
TITLE: 'Jorge Chato',
SITE_MAP: [
    {
      name: 'Home',
      url: '/',
      location: 'content/home.md',
    },
    {
      name: 'Status',
      url: '/status',
    },
    {
      name: 'About',
      url: '/about',
      location: 'content/about.md',
    },
    {
      name: 'Archive',
      url: '/archive',
    },
  ],
SOCIALS: [
    {
      name: 'GitHub',
      url: 'https://github.com/jorgechato',
    },
    {
      name: 'Twitter',
      url: 'https://twitter.com/jorgechato',
    },
    {
      name: 'LinkedIn',
      url: 'https://www.linkedin.com/in/jorgechato/',
    },
  ],
}
```

### Readme component

It gets the content of a markdown file and renders it as HTML.
It's required that you create a `/api/git/readme` endpoint that returns the content of a file in the repo as `string`.

### Repo component

It renders a project card with a title, description, tags and a link to the repo.
It's required that you create a `/api/git/repositories` endpoint that returns the following object as an object list.

```js
export interface Repository {
    name: string;
    description: string;
    url: string;
    homepageUrl: string;
    stargazerCount: number;
    forkCount: number;
    primaryLanguage: {
        name: string;
        color: string;
    };
}

// return Repository[]
```

### Project component

It renders a project card with a title, description, version, a link to the project...
It's part of the status page components, which means that it's going to check the health of your applications and render a status indicator.

I recommend you to have a `/api/health-check` endpoint that returns the following object in each project you want to add.

```js
export enum StatusType {
    OK = "OK",
    DEGRADED = "DEGRADED",
    MINOR = "MINOR",
    MAJOR = "MAJOR",
    MAINTENANCE = "MAINTENANCE",
    UNKNOWN = "UNKNOWN",
}

export interface Status {
    name: string;
    type: StatusType;
    url: string;
    version?: string;
    description?: string;
    color?: string;
    watching?: string;
}

// return Status
```

You will need to pass a list of project as a prop to the `ProjectList` component.
This is an example of a list of projects.

```js
projects = [
    {
      name: 'JORGE</br>CHATO',
      url: 'https://jorgechato.com/api/health-check',
    },
    {
      name: 'WHERE IS</br>JORGE TODAY?',
      url: 'https://whereisjorge.today/api/health-check',
    },
    {
      name: 'NO APTO</br>EN ASIA',
      url: 'https://noaptoen.asia/health-check.json',
    },
    {
      name: "WHAT IS JORGE</br>DOING TODAY?",
      url: '/api/health-check',
    },
  ]
```
